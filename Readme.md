# Web Visualization Dashboard (Lattitude)

## Background

I created a visualization dashboard using HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS.

The website is hosted here: https://bogordon86.github.io/Latitude-Vs_Weather/

My website has 7 pages:

* A landing page containing:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualizations page.
* Four visualization pages, each with:
  * A descriptive title and heading tag.
  * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
* A comparisons pagethat:
  * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
* Finally, it has a Data Page:
  * Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
